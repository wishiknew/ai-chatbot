Some say we′re never meant to grow up
I'm sure they never knew enough
I know the pressures won′t go
Away
It's too late
Find out we're different somehow
It′s too late to even have faith
Don′t think things will ever change

You must be dreaming
Think before you make up your mind
You don't seem to realize
I can do this on my own
And if I fall I′ll take it all

It's so easy after all
